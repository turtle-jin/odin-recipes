    <h3>Matcha Ice Cream</h3>
    <p><em>This rich and creamy matcha ice cream (green tea ice cream) 
        is one of our favorite ways to enjoy matcha. It's a slightly bitter, 
        yet perfectly sweet Japanese-inspired treat for any occasion. 
        It's easy to make at home, and you only need 5 ingredients!</em></p>

    <h3>What is Matcha?</h3>
    <P>Matcha is a green tea powder that comes from the young leaves of green tea plants. The plants are grown in the shade making the leaves high in chlorophyll and giving them a distinct bright green color.</P>

    <P>Matcha tastes earthy, bitter, vegetal, and slightly sweet. It's a well-loved flavor in Japan and is widely consumed in the form of tea, sweets, and even savory dishes.</P>

    <p>There are two main types of Matcha, <strong>ceremonial grade</strong> and <strong>culinary grade</strong>. While both yield a tasty matcha ice cream, here are the differences:</p>

    <p><strong>Ceremonial grade</strong> matcha is a higher quality matcha and you can recognize it by its vibrant green color. It tends to be higher in price and is meant to be mixed with water for tea ceremonies.</p>

    <p><strong>Culinary grade</strong>matcha tends to be a more muted green color, of slightly lower quality, and best for cooking.</p>

    <h3>How to make Matcha Ice Cream</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by whisking the milk, sugar, and egg yolks in a pot over medium heat. Whisk occasionally until the milk is steaming, then remove the pot from the heat.</li>
        <li>Now, mix the matcha powder with a few tablespoons of the hot milk until it forms a paste. This makes it easier to mix into the hot milk.</li>
        <li>Whisk the paste into the hot milk and then strain it through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. This step removes any bits of cooked egg – if there are any.</li>
        <li>To finish making the ice cream base, whisk in the whipping cream. Now you'll want to chill it in your fridge until it's completely cold.</li>
        <li>Once it's cold, pour it into your ice cream maker and churn it.</li>
        <li>After sneaking a few soft-serve style bites, transfer the rest of your matcha ice cream to a freezer-proof container and pop it into your freezer. That's it! Your homemade ice cream will keep well for about 2 weeks.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Milk</strong>-we use whole milk for that extra rich and creamy taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Granulated sugar</strong>-to sweeten it all up!</li>
        <li><strong>Egg yolks</strong>– egg yolk helps with the stability of the ice cream and works as an emulsifier.</li>
        <li><strong>Matcha Powder</strong>– we use ceremonial grade matcha because we love its bright green color.</li>
        <li><strong>Heavy cream</strong>– heavy cream (such as whipping cream) gives your ice cream a smooth texture and creamy taste.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You'll also need an ice cream maker. </p>
