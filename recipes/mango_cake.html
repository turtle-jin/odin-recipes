    <p class="intro"><em>I wanted this cake to taste like the tropics, be fork-tender, and sweet without being too sweet.

        None of the other mango crepe cakes out there satisfied me. I wanted something that was worth cooking those 20 crepes on the stove on a Monday morning. Flavorful. GOOD. Worth the time and effort.</em></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Mangoes</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp lime juice</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>8-oz pack cream cheese</li>
        <li>I am tired of this long list:( you can google the rest haha.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the mango coulis.</strong> In a medium pot over medium heat, add the mangoes, water, cinnamon, and cloves. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, and simmer covered for 23-30 minutes. Discard the water. Slice the mango flesh off the seed and add it to a food processor or blender. Puree until smooth, then return the pureed mango to the empty pot. Place the pot over medium-low heat, add the sugar, lime or lemon juice, and cornstarch dissolved in water and cook for 4-5 minutes or until combined and thickened. Stir constantly to keep the mango from bubbling up. Turn off the heat, transfer the mango coulis to a clean bowl and allow to cool down to room temperature.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Make the crepes</strong>Add the flour, milk, eggs, sugar, and melted butter to a bowl or a blender and mix or blend until smooth. Place a small non-stick pan over medium heat, grease with butter or non-stick spray, and add about 1/4 cup of batter to the pan. Quickly swirl the pan to get an even layer of batter and cook for about 50-60 seconds or until the crepe begins to set, then flip with a spatula, and cook for another 10-15 seconds. Transfer the cooked crepe to a clean dish and repeat. You should get about 20-21 crepes with this recipe.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Make the cream cheese filling.</strong>Add the cream cheese, powdered sugar, and coconut extract to a bowl. Using a mixer, beat until combined and fluffy. Then, add the cooled down mango coulis and shredded coconut and beat until combined. You can taste the filling and adjust the amount of coconut extract to your taste, if desired. Set aside.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Assemble the cake.</strong>Place the first crepe on a serving dish, add a dollop of mango filling on top, spread it into an even layer, top with another crepe, and repeat until all crepes have been used up. Cover the cake and place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 3-4 hours or overnight (recommended).</li>
        <li><strong>Decorate!</strong>To make the whipped cream topping, add the cold whipped cream and powdered sugar to a medium bowl, beat until fluffy with soft peaks. Add dollops of whipped cream to the top of your prepared crepe cake, then top with the remaining mango coulis, and chopped mango. Serve!</li>
